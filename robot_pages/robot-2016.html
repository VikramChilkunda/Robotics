        <h1 class="title">FRC 589 - 2016: First Stronghold</h1>
        <p>FIRST Stronghold is the 2016 FIRST Robotics Competition game. The game is played by
        two alliances of up to three teams each, and involves breaching the opponentsâ€™ defenses, 
        known as outer work as well as capturing their tower by first firing "boulders" (small foam balls)
        at it, and then surrounding or scaling the tower using a singular rung on the tower wall. Points 
        are scored by crossing elements of the tower's outer works, shooting boulders into the opposing 
        tower's five goals in order to lower the tower strength, and by surrounding and scaling the tower. 
        The name of the game was revealed on October 14, 2015 in a video that was produced with Walt Disney
        Imagineering. The details of the game were revealed at the kickoff event on January 9, 2016. For this 
        competition, the driver stations were split between the tower, with two driver stations to its left
        and one driver station to its right. Each team was given the option to display a team standard above
        the team's driver station. This standard was a small flag (made out of paper, cloth, or other flexible
        materials) and held up with a support structure built by the teams.
