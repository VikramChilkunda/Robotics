                                We have 6 weeks to understand the game, design, and built a robot to accomplish several tasks. 
                                The game includes a series of complex actions that if completed provide points that will rank our 
                                team higher, and help us win the competition. In addition we raise money by seeking sponsors and
                                providing outreach to establish the 589 name. Surpassing these obstacles help us grow as team,
                                work on our leadership skills, and learn how the real life works.</div>

                                        For those who have never heard of FLL before, it is a program in which elementary
                                        and middle school students make LEGO robots that accomplish specialized tasks. 
                                        This program encourages innovation, problem solving, and teamwork. The students
                                        are divided into groups of 10 that all work together to compete with other teams.
                                        We volunteer to mentor the students and keep them on task so that they can have a 
                                        engaging and enjoyable experience with STEAM.</div>

                                        an opportunity for the younger students to see what engineering is like,

                                provide points that will rank our team higher, and help us win the competition. In addition we raise money 
                                by seeking sponsors and providing outreach to establish the 589 name.</div>

                                FLL is a program in which elementary
                                and middle school students make LEGO robots that complete  tasks on a playing field. 
                                The students are divided into groups of 10 that all work together to compete with other teams.
                                We volunteer to mentor the students and keep them on task so that they can have a 
                                engaging and enjoyable experience with STEAM.</div>

                                It's a fun way to earn community service hours, and provides
                                an opportunity for the younger students to see what engineering is like, 
                                and possibly be inspired to seek a career in engineering.</div>

                                a helping hand, because every year we need enough money to cover
                                registration in FIRST, fund our robotics activities, and offset
                                transportation to competition. We need tools and parts to
                                build our robot so that we can all work together fluently. If you
                                would like to sponsor our team, set up a fundraiser (typically a dine-out), or donate to our team,
                                please contact Lyn-Repath Martos at lyn@cvrobots.com.</p>
